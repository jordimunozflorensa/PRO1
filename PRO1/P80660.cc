//Let n be any strictly positive natural number. Consider the                  following process. If n is an even number, we divide it by two. Otherwise, we multiply it by 3 and add 1 to it. When we reach 1, we stop. For instance, starting with 3, we obtain the sequence: 3,  10,  5,  16,  8,  4,  2,  1 .
#include <iostream>

        while (x != 1) {
            if (x%2 == 0) x /= 2;
            else x = (x*3) + 1;
